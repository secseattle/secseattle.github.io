##Adding new projects or new job postings

This can be done easily on github.

1 When looking at the code open the projects folder
2 Open a current file and copy the contents of that file.
3 Go back one page to projects folder
4 Click "New File" button
5 Paste the copied information in the new file and change the data for the new project
6 Once finished commit the new file at the bottom of the page
7 Go back to the code and open assets folder
8 Open images folder
9 Upload a full size image or the project by clicking "Upload Files button"
10 Then open resized folder
11 Upload a 400x300 sized copy of the same image put in images file

That will get a new project to appear on the projects page and a link to that project will work as well.

This is the same process to add a new job posting, just instead of in the projects folder, follow these steps in the careers folder
